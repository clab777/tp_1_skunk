School project - tp_1_skunk: Board Game

Similar to Cosmic Wimpout, but much easier and kid friendly. 
This is a very simple point-scoring/risk-taking game in which players roll a set of two dice, where the "1" has been replaced by a picture of a skunk. 
Everyone gets little poker chips, like in many gambling games, and a player rolls as much as he wishes during his turn, earning points equal to what he rolls. 
A player passes the dice when he wishes, but if he rolls one or two skunks, points rolled during that turn are ignored and penalties (in the form of discarding some of their poker chips) are enforced. 
First player to achieve 100 points (or higher) wins that round, and play continues for as long players wish. 
The winner is whoever has the most chips to his name (in typical poker values of 1, 5, and 10). 
Number of max players seems to be only limited by the number of poker chips you use (each player starts with 50). 
This game is no longer manufactured, at least under the theme of "Skunk."
